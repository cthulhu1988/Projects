Arduino - Wemos RFID and Painless Mesh
Arduino - Wemos RFID and Painless Mesh An attempt was made to create a rudimentary blockchain using a wemos d1 mini clone and an MRC522 sensor. Please see the esp8666R1D1 project folder for details. The Hashing and RFID Implementation folders were just for experimentation. Atom and the platformIO plugin were utilized.
